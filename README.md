# Snowflake Tagging Assistant

The Snowflake Tagging Assistant was designed to help control Snowflake spend by applying tagging 
to warehouses, and making that process easy.

To run this application locally, you will need to install Python, and the requirements found 
in `requirements.txt`

Once Python is installed, open a command prompt and CD to the repository directory. Then run 
`pip install -r requirements.txt` and it should install all the necessary packages.

Then run `streamlit run warehouse_tagging_assistant.py`.

If running this locally is too difficult, feel free to try out the [Snowflake Tagging Assistant on Streamlit Cloud](https://jnschurig-snowflake-assistan-warehouse-tagging-assistant-k0mmww.streamlitapp.com/).
